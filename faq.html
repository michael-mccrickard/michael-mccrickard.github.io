<h2>Geohacker FAQ</h2>

<h3>Your map is incomplete.  Where’s Singapore?  Where’s Samoa? (etc.)</h3>

<p>We currently use a low-resolution map in Geohacker, with 174 countries on it. The smaller countries are not on this map.  We hope to move to a different mapping system in the coming year, which will allow us to include most of the smaller nations.
</p>

<h3>I got assigned to: (insert a country name here).  What does that mean?</h3>

  <p>We currently assign a country to each new user at random.  At the moment, all this does is determine the initial flag, picture and text we load on your “wall” (your Bio page, which you get to by clicking the large picture of yourself on the Home screen menu strip.)  We strongly encourage to customize your wall with your own  pics and your own text.  If you want to be assigned to a different country, just email us using the link in the Geohacker menu.</p>

<h3>Your map of Europe is inaccurate.  It should include part of Russia.</h3>
 
  <p>
Correct.  The normal eastern boundary of Europe is along the Ural and Caucasus mountains.  However, the Geohacker system is very hierarchical, in that it divides up the globe into continents, regions and countries.  At this time, every country has to be on a single continent in order to make the map system work correctly.  So we use what is essentially a political boundary in Europe, putting all of Russia onto the Asian continent.  Our users have found this arrangement to be quite easy to get used to, even if it is non-standard geographically.

<h3>Who are these Geohacker-in-Chiefs who sometimes appear in the game?  Can I be one?</h3>

  <p>
    Absolutely.  We would like every country to have a Geohacker-in-Chief (GIC) that is a real person; either someone who lives there, or is from there, or has strong connections to the place.   Failing that, we want every country to have a GIC that is a historical person or some kind of celebrity (these are our Virtual and Honorary agents, respectively).  Write us, using the Contact Us link in the Geohacker menu and tell us why you should be GIC for your desired country.  Or tell us someone famous who should be the GIC.

<h3>Could you create a mission with a certain list of countries for use in my classroom?</h3>

  <p>Yes, and we can do it quickly.  Just write us!</p>
